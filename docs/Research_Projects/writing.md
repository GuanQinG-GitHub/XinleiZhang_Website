# Tips for conducting research

## What should be done in the first stage of a research project (before going into any implementations)
1. Literature review
   1. Prior works A,B,C, drawbacks of A,B,C, and why. Try to answer the question: How this work improves their drawbacks, and what this work can achieve.
   2. How prior works A,B,C design simulation or experiment to validate their method, and evaluate the performance
   3. Why their simulation or experiment result is not good
2. Draft the introduction section from the literature review
3. Design the simulation and experiment validation and evaluation for the paper. What we're going to present to readers.

## Writing Tips
- In the introduction paragraphs, start with a sentence to summarize the following paragraph
- What is an appropriate contribution? 
  - Theoretical sense
  - Practical sense: The adavantage of this work comparing to prior works, superior simulation & experiment performance
- In the section after introduction (or related-works), give a clear and concise **problem definition**. What's the goal of this work, what does this paper want to achieve
- In the first paragraph of a section or a subsection, start with a summary paragraph about how this section or subsection is organized, and high-level flow
- Before a theorem or lemma, first talk about what's the usage of the following theorem or lemma, why reader should read these theorems or lemmas
- For simulaition or experimental result, try to analyze the results instead of listing the number
- Notice the readability of a paragraph or a sentence.
  - Try to avoid a long sentence which requires a long breath to read
  - Be careful about the transition of paragraphs. Try to make the logic behind the transition clear.
  - Make each sentence compact and informative
  - prefer active not passive sense
- For the abstract and conlusion paragraphs, reader should be able to understand these two paragraphs without any refer to the body part.
- When cite a textbook, the specific chapter should be cited.
- Write conclusive message from the author's aspect, e.g., prior work cannot do xxx, so it's better that your work can do xxx and have explanation about this.
