### Lab 7
[Click here to download the Lab 7 assignment description](Experiment%206—Building%20the%20PD%20Controller%20-%20Content.pdf)
- Needs to know:
  - PD controller
  - Explain the reason for process variable block
  - Expected results: given a set point voltage, the motor will drive the pot until the voltage on the pot equal to the given set point
  - Build the circuit and assemble the pendulum at the same time
  - Deliverable: circuit results after each block, physical system test is not required
    - to build 
  - Check points:
    - Output from
      - Set Point block, let's set the output from set point, i.e.,, the voltage on the pot, to be 10 V; the output from process variable to be 5 V
      - Error block
      - Proportional block
      - Derivative block
      - Summer blocker
    - Pendulum
      - drive the motor with 2v (disconnect the belt)
